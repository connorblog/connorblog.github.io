Trillian and I visited Ireland for 10 days and I took enough cool pictures that I wanted to share them 
in a nice way and not on social media sites which are all annoying in their own ways... so I used this 
as an excuse to set up a blog website which I've wanted to do for a while.

We saw my family, mostly first cousins of my mom (Tim, Donal, Pamela, Tracy, Tara) and their families, 
which was really great. We also hung out with Socialist Party of Ireland members (ISA) and went to a 
branch meeting. The trip was a really nice mix of seeing sights and people.

I took these pictures on my Pixel 6. You can click on them to view them fullscreen/full res.

### Dublin

Dublin was the least picturesque area but still cool. We also had our only rainy day here. 
We spent two and a half days before getting the car and driving around. 
Driving was terrifying btw and I thought I was going to die before we started to avoid small rural roads that have an
80 km/h speed limit but don't even fit 2 cars (or worse, fit 2 cars with literally less than 2 feet total buffer space
between the cars and hedges, cliffs, or stone walls).

The Old Library at Trinity college. lots of very old books incl the Book of Kells from 800 AD. Prob not worth the admission fee.
{{ shrink_lazy_link_img("/images/", "PXL_20220912_142613545-Connolly.jpg") }}
James Connolly, revolutionary socialist and trade unionist, martyred during the Easter Rising.
The Big Dipper behind him as a plow symbolizes that labour should own everything up to the stars. Pretty cool.

{{ shrink_lazy_link_img("/images/2022-9-10-Dublin/", "PXL_20220913_160612282.jpg") }}
Kilmainham Jail, longtime symbol of British imperialism, where Connolly was kept and executed. 
This nice-looking room was designed by perversely moralistic Victorian jailers. 

On this trip I learned that during the Great Famine, more food was actually produced than needed to feed 
the Irish people, but the British ruling class exported it by force. 
<a href="https://www.socialistparty.ie/2022/03/an-gorta-mor-the-legacy-of-the-irish-famine/">Ireland is one of the only places in the world today with a smaller population than it had in 1845.</a> 
The population of the total island was 8.2 million then, but over the course of the famine over 1 million 
died and 3 million eventually emigrated. The British ruling class and local capitalists used the 
opportunity to intentionally depopulate the formerly self-sustaining rural areas and replace the 
people with cattle farming and industrial crops. Many emigres went on to provide cheap labor in 
England and the US, and today the combined Irish population is 7.0 million. 
I'll stop political blogging now but this was a shock to me even though it's common knowledge over there.

### Doolin

Doolin and the area around it were awesome. We saw really cool trad music at a pub (McDermotts).
We spent most of a day on Inis Mor, the biggest of the Aran islands, biking around. 
From this point onwards we had perfect weather.

<div markdown="1">
{{ shrink_lazy_link_img("/images/", "PXL_20220915_182532216-cliffs-of-moher.jpg") }}

{{ shrink_lazy_link_img("/images/", "PXL_20220915_114850122-inis-more-fort.jpg") }}
Ruined fort on Inis Mor built around 1800 by the British to see if Napoleon was invading and light a series of torches like in lord of the rings.
There's another one between the islands and the cliffs and another 1 or 2 on the cliffs.

### Limerick

We stopped by Limerick for lunch and to look at some historical spots because there was a significant 
Soviet declared here in 1919. It was provoked by British military occupation and requiring workers to show
ID to move anywhere around the city or go to work. The workers took power and ran the city for 2 weeks, 
printing their own money.

### Dingle

We spent 2 nights on the Dingle peninsula. There is a road around it called Slea Head drive 
that offers nonstop stunning landscape views and some historical stuff.

<div markdown="1">

enclosed "beehive" huts were made by stacking rocks without mortar again, and also date from 500-800 AD I think.

the big dipper was really bright.

### Killarney

Killarney is described by everyone online as a tourist trap and almost every single experience inside the city
was bad. The low point was when I ordered buffalo wings (after eating the best buffalo wings of my life in 
Doolin) and received 5 breaded wings with BARBECUE sauce on them. But the national park was incredible and 
renting bikes to ride around it was perfect. We also had our first overcast afternoon in a while which was a 
nice change of pace.

### Kilkenny

Kilkenny was gorgeous. It feels more like an old european town than most other places due to being developed 
in the middle ages but not expanding a huge amount more (I think?) since. From 1641-1649 it was the seat of 
Irish self-government beyond the British-controlled Pale.
